# Yolo2 & 3
This session was about the yolo3 architecture

## *Assignment*
should use open cv to triain coco images
annotate all the images collected through yolo 3 tool
Should collect 500 images of hard hats, mask, vest and boots annotate them, take small yotube video where the trained object is present and run the model on top of it and detect the object and class.

## Implementation
1. Collected 500 images for hard hats, mask, vest and boots from internet
2. Annotated them with yolo3 new tool.
3. Refered [this](https://github.com/theschoolofai/YoloV3) repo for implementation.
4. Ran for 300 epochs.
5 And then tried to predict for 4 classes.
