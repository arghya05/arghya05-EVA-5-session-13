# Yolo2 & 3
This session was about the yolo2 and 3 architecture

## *Assignment*
Should collect 500 images annotate them, take small yotube video where the trained object is present and run the model on top of it and detect the object
and class.

## Implementation
1. Collected 500 images of woody character from toy story.
2. Annotated them.
3. Refered [this](https://github.com/theschoolofai/YoloV3) repo for implementation.
4. Ran for 300 epochs.
5 And then tried to predict for 3 classes.
